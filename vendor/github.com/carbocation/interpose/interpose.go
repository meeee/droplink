/*
Interpose is a minimalist Golang middleware that uses only `http.Handler` and
`func(http.Handler)http.Handler`. Interpose takes advantage of closures to create
a stack of native net/http middleware. Unlike other middleware libraries which
create their own net/http-like signatures, interpose uses literal net/http
signatures, thus minimizing package lock-in and maximizing inter-compatibility.

Middleware is called in nested FIFO fashion, which means that the first middleware
to be added will be the first middleware to be called. Because the middleware is
nested, it actually means that the first middleware to be added gets the
opportunity to make the first and the last calls in the stack. For example,
if there are 3 middlewares added in order (0, 1, 2), the calls look like so:

	//0 START
		//1 START
			//2 START
			//2 END
		//1 END
	//0 END
